About
=====
Boxee-xPL is a script that allows Boxee or XBMC to interface with home automation software such as misterhouse over the xPL protocol.
Current supported commands are play, stop, skip, and pause.  Media information is broadcast whenever a new song or video starts.

Installation
============
Copy boxee-xPL.py into your XBMC scripts folder:

Boxee on linux: ~/.boxee/UserData/scripts
Boxee on Mac OS X: ~/Library/Application Support/BOXEE/UserData/scripts

Create a new file named "autoexec.py" in the scripts folder, and paste in the following two lines:

import xbmc
xbmc.executescript('special://masterprofile/scripts/boxee-xPL.py')

Usage
=====
Boxee will register itself on the network and respond to requests according to the MEDIA.BASIC schema.
A sample script is included for connecting Boxee to misterhouse. Copy the files in the misterhouse/ folder
into your misterhouse code/ folder, and edit boxee.pl to set the hostname of the computer running Boxee.
